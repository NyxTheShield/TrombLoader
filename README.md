# IMPORTANT!
*If you are here, you were likely following an outdated modding guide.*
All mods (including TrombLoader) are now hosted on **Thunderstore**.
You can use **r2modman** to easily manage your mods on *Windows* and *Linux*.
If you are on *MacOS*, you can use [**Candygoblen123's mod manager**](https://github.com/Candygoblen123/TromboneChampModManager) in place of r2modman

Please follow [**this guide**](https://trombone.wiki/#/installing-r2modman) or [**this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6msFI8Sz1UQ) if you wish to mod your game.
